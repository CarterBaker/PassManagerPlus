Java Password Manager
Overview

Java Password Manager is a lightweight application designed to securely manage and log your passwords. The software currently supports password storage and logging, with plans to implement strong encryption mechanisms to safeguard sensitive information.
Features

    Store and organize passwords efficiently

    Log password usage and modifications

    (Planned) Encrypt stored passwords using strong cryptographic algorithms

    (Planned) Secure user authentication and access control

Installation

    Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/java-password-manager.git

Build the project with your preferred Java build tool (e.g., Maven, Gradle) or compile manually:

javac -d bin src/*.java

Run the application:

    java -cp bin Main

Usage

    Launch the application.

    Add, view, and manage your passwords.

    Passwords will be logged for auditing purposes.

    Encryption features will be added in future versions.

Security Considerations

    Passwords are currently stored in plain text for development purposes.

    Future releases will include encryption using industry-standard algorithms such as AES.

    It is recommended to keep this software and stored data on secure, trusted devices.

    Avoid sharing password data or logs without proper protection.

Roadmap

    Implement AES encryption for stored passwords

    Add user authentication (e.g., master password)

    Improve UI/UX for easier password management

    Add import/export functionality with encryption

    Integrate secure password generation tool
