## 🧩 PassManagerPlus: a password manager prototype

**Solo-developed systems architecture prototype** built in 4 hours using Java to showcase my programming skills. Java is very
similar to C# which is the langauge I am most familiar with. The project was cut short before reaching the final vision for it
mainly due to time constraints to focus on other priorities.

---

## 🎮 Core Features

- 🌍 **Password Save System**  
  - View and manage saved passwords

- 🧙 **Privacy Focus**  
  - Passwords are initially blocked/ not shown until you need to see them to prevent over the shoulder identity theft.

---

## 🔮 Future Plans
  - Decryption and encryption algorithms to better protect saved password security.

## 🧠 Developer Notes

  The main focus of this project was just to showcase my knowledge of Java as a langauge and get a feel for security concerns.
  At this time I did not posess the time to bring this project to it's final vision due mainly to time constraints.
